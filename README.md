# Contact-Book-App
A contact book developed in python with Tkinter as GUI

This is a project that I developed for practice. It was develped in python with the Tkinter library as GUI and MySQL as DBMS. 

To try this project you need to have installed MySQL and execute the "Address Book Database.sql" in the MySQL server.

## What libraries are used in the project?

Pymsql: it is a library to connect to MySQL with python.
Tkinter: as GUI
Re: it is used to validate the emails and phone numbers added.

The project is a CRUD which allows to add contacts, to select them, to update their info and delete them. The GUI shows a list with all the contacts you haved added ordered by their first name letter:

Each contact in the list is a button that when pressed shows the phone number and an option to see all the contact info:

*It's a fake phone number, just for an example.*

It's easy to use and has very friendly GUI. :smiley:
