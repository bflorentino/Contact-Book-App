# Contact-Book-App
A contact book developed in python with Tkinter as GUI

This is a project that I developed for practice. It was develped in python with the Tkinter library as GUI and MySQL as DBMS. 

To try this project you need to have installed MySQL and execute the "Address Book Database.sql" in the MySQL server.

The project is a CRUD that allows to add contacts, to select them, to update their info and delete them. The GUI shows a list with all the contacts you haved added ordered by their first letter name:
